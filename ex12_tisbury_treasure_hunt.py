# Personal notes
"""
This learning exercise helped evolve your knowledge of Tuples.

A tuple is an immutable collection of items in sequence. Therefore, tuples
doesn't support mutable sequence operations.

Like most collections, tuples can hold any (or multiple) data types.

Tuples can be formed in multiple ways, using either:
>>> no_elements = tuple()
>>> no_elements
()
>>> no_elements = ()
>>> no_elements
()

>>> multiple_elements_string = tuple('Bernadete')
>>> multiple_elements_string
('B', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'a', 'd', 'e', 't', 'e')

Tuples can be concatenated using the + operator, which unpacks each
tuple creating a new, combined tuple.
>>> new_via_concatenate = ('George', 5) + ('cat', 'Tabby')
('George', 5, 'cat', 'Tabby')

>>> first_group = ('cat', 'dog')
>>> multiplied_group = first_group * 3
('cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog')

Elements within a tuple can be accessed via backet notation.
>>> student_info = ('Alyssa', 'grade 3', 'female', 8)
>>> student_name = student_info[0]
'Alyssa'

You can use the following loops:
for item in <tuple>
for index, item in enumerate(<tuple>)

And you can also copy tuples using slice notation:
<tuple>[start:stop:step]

You can use the in operator to check for membership.
>>> multiple_elements_list = tuple(['RagnarÃ¶k', 'Pauper'])
>>> pauper in multiple_elements_list
True

# Instructions
"""
Azara and Rui are teammates competing in a pirate-themed treasure hunt.

One has a list of treasures with map coordinates, the other a list of location
names with map coordinates. They've also been given blank maps with a starting
place marked YOU ARE HERE.

But things are a bit disorganized: Azara's coordinates appear to be
formatted and sorted differently from Rui's, and they have to keep
looking from one list to the other to figure out which treasures
go with which locations.

Being budding pythonistas, they have come to you for help in writing
a small program to better organize their hunt information

# 1. Extract coordinates
"""
Implement the get_coordinate() function that takes a (treasure, coordinate)
pair from Azara's list and returns only the extracted map coordinate.

# 2. Format coordinates
"""
Implement the convert_coordinate() function that takes a coordinate in the format
"2A" and returns a tuple in the format ("2", "A").

def convert_coordinate(coordinate):

# 3. Match coordinates
"""
Implement the compare_records() function that takes a (treasure, coordinate) pair
and a (location, coordinate, quadrant) record and compares coordinates from each.

Return True if the coordinates "match" and False if they do not.

Re-format coordinates as needed for accurate comparison.

# 5. Clean up and make a report of all records

Clean up the combined records from Azara and Rui so that there's only one
set of coordinates per record.

Make a report so they can see one list of everything they need to put on
their maps.

Implement the clean_up() function that takes a tuple of tuples (everything
from both lists), looping throught the outer tuple, dropping the unwanted
coordinates from each inner tuple and adding each to a "report".

Format and return the "report" so that there is one cleaned record on each
line.
